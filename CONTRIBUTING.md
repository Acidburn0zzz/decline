A couple quick notes for contributors:
-   We use the standard Scala COC here!
-   `decline` is designed to generate very standard UNIXy command line interfaces;
    we want to innovate in the interface we expose to Scala, not to Bash!
    "Command-line facing" changes should be motivated by either pointing to the POSIX or GNU standards,
    or to a number of existing common programs that use that style already.
